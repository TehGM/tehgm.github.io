Many want tips and tricks, but some are interested in mods as well&mldr; and just happens that this game has a great modding community. Mods <em>almost</em> always have been one of pillars of the series, and X4 is no different - some mods are so good and so essential so I personally can&rsquo;t imagine playing this game without them.</p><div class="details admonition success open"><div class="details-summary admonition-title"><i class="icon fas fa-check-circle fa-fw"></i>2024 Update<i class="details-icon fas fa-angle-right fa-fw"></i></div><div class=details-content><div class=admonition-content>The post has been updated for Kingdom End and Timelines DLCs - game version 7.10 is in beta 2 as I am updating this post.</div></div></div><p>In this article I will showcase some of the mods I personally use and briefly explain what each mod does. Do note though that this list is definitely not conclusive - there are many other great mods for X4 out there, but I simply don&rsquo;t use them. But the opposite also applies - just because a mod is listed below, no one says you <em>have</em> to use it. This list is meant to be just my personal recommendation, from which you can mix and match as you please.</p><p>I cannot guarantee any of the mod works for you or that it doesn&rsquo;t conflict with other mods, as I don&rsquo;t maintain any of these. However I do play with them, so I can confirm that they work <em>for me</em>.</p><div class="details admonition warning open"><div class="details-summary admonition-title"><i class="icon fas fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw"></i>Mods and Balance<i class="details-icon fas fa-angle-right fa-fw"></i></div><div class=details-content><div class=admonition-content>Mods often affect balance, and some can affect it more than others.

For me it&rsquo;s all cool, but a warning is due!</div></div></div><div class="details admonition warning open"><div class="details-summary admonition-title"><i class="icon fas fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw"></i>Mod Updates<i class="details-icon fas fa-angle-right fa-fw"></i></div><div class=details-content><div class=admonition-content>Another mandatory warning is that mods might break and not be updated when a large game update or new DLC is out. It likely won&rsquo;t happen with most mods, and mods made by Shuulo (VRO) or kuertee are probably pretty safe (as they got hired by Egosoft, congrats guys!), but it&rsquo;s definitely worth keeping in mind.</div></div></div><h2 id=dlcs>DLCs</h2><p>Wait wait, DLCs? Aren&rsquo;t we supposed to talk about mods?<br>Well, yes. However if you think about it, DLCs kinda are like mods, and they contribute to the experience of the game, so I decided to still list them.</p><p>Most mods don&rsquo;t require DLCs usually, but some (like VRO for example) do. Also in this game it&rsquo;s usually worth to start fresh when you install a new DLC just so you don&rsquo;t let a new faction fall behind - and this is even more true when your mods affect balance.</p><p>Which DLCs do I recommend? Before Timelines I used to say all of them. Now&mldr; it&rsquo;s a bit more complicated (although I still personally would - and did - just pick all of them up).<br>But I&rsquo;ll list them in order from most important to least important.</p><h3 id=cradle-of-humanity>Cradle of Humanity</h3><p>Adds entire Sol. That alone is huge. But Terrans and Seagaris Pioneers factions also have their own unique and <em>sleek</em> ships, their own campaigns, and even own economy. And to be honest&mldr; they&rsquo;re OP (well, Terrans are). Simplified economy means it&rsquo;s harder to cripple, and their ships are quite strong. But regardless of that, this DLC offers a lot of new stuff, and as such is really worth it - even if like myself, you largely focus on commonwealth economy instead of terran one cause you don&rsquo;t want to make the logistical gameplay shallow for yourself.</p><p>Links: <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1288460/X4_Cradle_of_Humanity/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Steam</a> | <a href=https://www.gog.com/en/game/x4_cradle_of_humanity target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">GOG</a></p><h3 id=split-vendetta>Split Vendetta</h3><p>Expands <span class="spoiler hidden"><span class=text>the northern</span></span> part of the map adding a fair amount of new sectors, primarily occupied by the race of Split. Split are focused on firepower, and gotta say, their ships look quite cool. And of course there are new campaign missions as well.</p><p>Links: <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133000/X4_Split_Vendetta/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Steam</a> | <a href=https://www.gog.com/en/game/x4_split_vendetta target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">GOG</a></p><h3 id=tides-of-avarice>Tides of Avarice</h3><p>Out of currently released DLCs, this one adds the least amount of new sectors and ships. What it makes up with however is the uniqueness - of the new sectors, as well as gameplay mechanics.</p><p>The new sectors look really <em>really</em> interesting, especially Windfall which admittedly looks like <span class="spoiler hidden"><span class=text>if it was in the throat of a giant space monster</span></span>. But it&rsquo;s mechanics where this DLC shines at: the tides that happen in Avarice system are a brand new mechanic that adds some time tension while you&rsquo;re in the system. Combine this with completely new salvaging-based economy, which Avarice uses for everything, and you have a DLC worth getting in general. And as always, there are new campaigns in this one, too.</p><p>Links: <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1701060/X4_Tides_of_Avarice/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Steam</a> | <a href=https://www.gog.com/en/game/x4_tides_of_avarice target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">GOG</a></p><h3 id=kingdom-end>Kingdom End</h3><p>One thing needs to be known about this DLC - Borons are back! Yes, fans of X series longed for Borons ever since X4 released (or perhaps even since X Rebirth). Egosoft had to think how to add them in carefully (yakno, Borons being aquatic creatures doesn&rsquo;t mix all too well with ability to walk on your ship). But looks like they came up with a solution, and our pacifists are back in the series.</p><p>They have their own campaign, ships and sectors (obviously), but also own unique station modules that look really brilliant. And they kept the unique soundtrack of Kingdom End sector! &lt;3</p><p>On the flip side&mldr; I had tough time picking where it should go on this list. While there&rsquo;s new sectors, it feels that there are less of them than in Split Vendetta. The campaign is also short, and mechanically it&rsquo;s less rich than Tides of Avarice. For these reasons I decided to, at least for now, list Borons after both of these DLCs. Sorry my aquatic fellas!</p><p>Links: <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1990040/X4_Kingdom_End/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Steam</a> | <a href=https://www.gog.com/en/game/x4_kingdom_end target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">GOG</a></p><h3 id=timelines>Timelines</h3><p>The latest DLC we got, and probably the most controversial one.</p><p>The gist of this DLC is a separate mode which is quick mission based. Some of these missions feel nice, like something new - others are purely tedious. It&rsquo;s also advertised as letting players replay old events from the series, but sadly I have to say, only some of these missions have events that are recognizable or were impactful in previous games. Most feel just&mldr; random.</p><p>That said, I still kinda recommend playing it. Part of it cause I am a long-time series fan - but also cause completing the missions in Timelines does add stuff to open world. The additions maybe aren&rsquo;t many or that significant, but completing the Timelines does add at least some sectors, ships, and other unique things.<br>But I also understand people who will skip this DLC altogether.</p><p>Links: <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2700340/X4_Timelines/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Steam</a> | <a href=https://www.gog.com/en/game/x4_timelines target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">GOG</a></p><h2 id=essential-mods>Essential Mods</h2><p>Now with DLCs all explained, let&rsquo;s finally get to the mods. I&rsquo;ll start with the mods I personally consider essential. You&rsquo;re free to decide if you need any of these or not - they&rsquo;re essential to ME.</p><h3 id=variety-and-rebalance-overhaul>Variety and Rebalance Overhaul</h3><p>If there&rsquo;s a mod that I can&rsquo;t imagine playing without, it&rsquo;s VRO. The simplest way to explain what it does is already in the name, but this mod really does&mldr; a lot. All ships got rebalanced, all weapons and missiles got replaced, adds some new ships to fulfill role gaps, and increases speed limit as it&rsquo;s created with <a href=#nosuperhighway rel>NoSuperHighway mod</a> in mind. It also makes the game harder, as a small fighter now stands little chance against corvette, yet alone a capital ship - but honestly, that&rsquo;s how it should be in the first place. That said, obvious balance change warning here.</p><p>This mod has 2 quirks to be aware of: it requires DLCs, and it is not compatible with vanilla saves. You need to start a fresh game if you install it - but it&rsquo;s worth it if you ask me.</p><p>Author: Shuulo<br>Links: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1696862840" target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Steam Workshop</a> | <a href=https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/305 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Nexus</a></p><h3 id=better-piracy>Better Piracy</h3><p>In X4, pirating small ships is a hit and miss. It&rsquo;s pure RNG, and it&rsquo;s fine if you don&rsquo;t actually care about stealing ships - but if you want to make piracy one of your main focuses, it becomes an annoyance.</p><p>That&rsquo;s where this mod comes in. It replaces the RNG small and medium ship piracy with something more predictable - the RNG is still there technically, but given time (and potentially shield on your ship in case you&rsquo;re being attacked), you eventually will get the ship.<br>The mod is highly customizable - I personally made it more difficult than default to not make things too easy.<br>The mod also can affect boarding capital ships - however I don&rsquo;t use that part of the mod, as it just makes boarding easier imo.</p><div class="details admonition bug open"><div class="details-summary admonition-title"><i class="icon fas fa-bug fa-fw"></i>Bug Reports<i class="details-icon fas fa-angle-right fa-fw"></i></div><div class=details-content><div class=admonition-content><p>Note: you might hear from people that this mod no longer works, however according to my testing, it&rsquo;s only partially true.</p><p>There appear to be issues when you order NPC ships to do piracy - but the Harass option is still there when flying the ship yourself. I actually make extensive use of this feature and have a great success.<br>It&rsquo;s been commented by <em>iomatix</em> that he&rsquo;ll work on fixing the mod - but until then, it still works as a <strong>significant</strong> improvement to vanilla piracy.</p></div></div></div><p>Author: Alberto Rota<br>Links: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2056100433" target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Steam Workshop</a> | <a href=https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/491 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Nexus</a></p><h3 id=constant-corruption-tehgms-update>Constant Corruption (TehGM&rsquo;s Update)</h3><p>Black Market works a strange way in X4 - you have to scan a signal leak on a station with black marketeer, do a specific mission for him, and only then you can sell illegal goods. However that part is rather fine.<br>What is a big problem is that, at least in my playthrough (not sure if it was cause of mods or game bug), they barely spawn in the galaxy. This made it really painful to get any proper illegal goods production running.<br>I also delved into game&rsquo;s code and found that the black market guys don&rsquo;t even spawn randomly - their spawn is determined when starting a new game. So if your save is unlucky, it&rsquo;ll stay unlucky forever.</p><p>This mod exists to alter that. Constant Corruption makes it so over time more black marketeers spawn in the galaxy.</p><p>However I had mixed results with this mod - the way it&rsquo;s designed, it&rsquo;ll make whopping 40% of stations covered in black market guys in a timespan that is big on paper, but given nature of the game is actually relatively short.<br>Worse yet, trying to debug this mod, I found that it didn&rsquo;t seem to work for me at all!<br>What I decided to do is take matters into my own hands. I altered the mod&rsquo;s code - I fixed bugs and tampered it down slightly (only 12% of stations will have black markets). I also cleaned up the code so it&rsquo;s easier to adjust the % and the speed of this mod (<em>line 162 determines how often black market spawn will be attempted, lines 50 and 51 control max coverage and number of levels, and line 52 controls timeout between levels</em>).</p><p>Author: Vectorial1024 (original mod) & TehGM (fix and rebalance update)<br>Links: <a href=/download/const_corruption_tehgm_update.zip rel>Download TehGM&rsquo;s Update</a> | <a href=https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/392 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Original version on Nexus</a></p><h3 id=recycle-ships-and-stations>Recycle Ships and Stations</h3><p>As you can tell, I&rsquo;m really going for piracy-oriented playthroughs. One of the challenges I set for myself was to never buy any ship, or any ship/station/module blueprint - I wanted everything do be procured by&mldr; my own means, to say so.<br>The game allows to hack station modules, unfortunately currently there&rsquo;s no way to reverse engineer ships and ship modules - you have to buy blueprints off factions, which is what I didn&rsquo;t want to do.</p><p>This is where this mod comes in. It allows you to reverse engineer any ship on your wharfs and shipyards for a chance to get blueprint of the ship itself and any module it has fitted. In addition, it adds a station module that allows you to do this even before you have your own shipyard (I admit I bought this blueprint, as no faction builds it so this was the only way to get it).</p><p><em>Small note: internal shield generators from VRO mod have super low chance to get with this mod, so I won&rsquo;t blame you if you just buy blueprints for these.</em></p><p>Author: iforgotmysocks<br>Links: <a href=https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/72 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Nexus</a></p><h3 id=disable-encounters>Disable Encounters</h3><p>A mod smaller than previous ones, but still important for immersion imo.</p><p>In X4, game can spawn random ships around you no matter where you are, just to provide you some content. I, and seemingly many others, find it pretty immersion breaking.<br>All this mod does is disable that. One downside is that patrol side-missions can look bugged as no new ships will spawn, but that&rsquo;s minor sacrifice for a greater immersion imo.</p><p>Author: MegaJohnny<br>Links: <a href=https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/85 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Nexus</a></p><h3 id=mules-supply-and-warehouses-extended>Mules, Supply and Warehouses Extended</h3><p>Economy and trading in X4 play a huge role, and you&rsquo;ll definitely want a fleet of transport ships transporting goods between your stations - be it for sale or further production.<br>The game itself has support for station traders, but they&rsquo;re&mldr; limited, and admittedly wonky.</p><p>Mules mod adds a new set of highly customizable orders for trade ships. This makes it much easier to set up automated logistics without even assigning a ship to a station (although ofc you can do that too)!</p><p>Author: MoistDreams & doctorhay53<br>Links: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2013772865" target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Steam Workshop</a> | <a href=https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/416 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Nexus</a></p><h3 id=hazard-rework>Hazard Rework</h3><p>Hazard sectors in X4 are&mldr; interesting. I understand what they were going for, and I like that idea.<br>The problem is the execution - while it works great when you&rsquo;re flying your own ship, hazard is just a serial killer for AI ships that just fly into hazard zones, get stuck and die. This becomes especially apparent with one certain sector in Boron DLC.</p><p>This mod addresses that by making Hazard regions not affect ship hull. Shields still get damaged, but at least stupid AI doesn&rsquo;t die all the time.</p><p>Author: draeath<br>Links: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2440309187" target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Steam Workshop</a> | <a href=https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/770/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Nexus</a></p><h3 id=legacy-music>Legacy Music</h3><p>Now a mod that doesn&rsquo;t even change gameplay at all, but because of my nostalgia, it&rsquo;s my personal must-have.</p><p>This mod expands in-game soundtrack by adding a lot of songs from previous X games.

Just after installing, it changes pretty much nothing. But then you can customize the amount of combat ships each faction will aim to produce.<br>The configuration is done via XML file, which might be scary for less tech-savvy folks, but don&rsquo;t worry - all you have is to change some values to your liking.

This makes player going into wars inevitable, making the game much more interesting and fun!<br>Reactive Factions was originally developed by Shuulo.

You can use it for tracking log messages, highlight log messages based on key words, track missions, research, money, reputation and more.</p><p>If you only have one screen it&rsquo;s probably pointless, but if you play on a multi-monitor setup it&rsquo;s insanely helpful. All information it provides can be accessed in-game, but having it open on second screen without having to go through in-game menus is a huge QoL feature.</p><p>Author: Mycu<br>Links: <a href=https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/818 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Nexus</a></p><h3 id=head-hunter>Head Hunter</h3><p>So, reports are that <a href=#better-kill-credit rel>Better Kill Credit</a> mod no longer works. Head Hunter comes in with the rescue - now all kills can reward a small reward. But the reward is small as that&rsquo;s not the meat of what this mod offers.</p><p>The mod also adds accumulating bounties on ships. As ships kill other ships, they accumulate bounty over bounty and can easily be wanted for millions of credits over time. Kill them and you get the payout. It can feel a bit OP, but it&rsquo;s all customizable - I set the bounty amount to 50%, and I think it&rsquo;s great.</p><p>Your own ships can also be hunted by other bounty hunters. These bounty hunters actually look for you instead of just spawning. Once they find you, you either fight or comm them to pay off your bounty 10x its value.<br>Unfortunately I ended up disabling this particular feature. It worked great in the beginning - being hunted for my crimes against HOP and others felt immersive and added an interesting layer to the game. The problems started when I started using fleets for wars - it&rsquo;d be fine if only enemy bounty hunters tried to kill your assets, but why do Argons etc hunt my ships for killing HOP assets?</p><p>But overall, this mod is fine addition, and is pretty customizable. Also offers a nice in-map view and bounty search tab, making it quite seamless to use.</p><p>Author: Chillmatica<br>Links: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2992233767" target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Steam Workshop</a> | <a href=https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/1150 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Nexus</a></p><h3 id=emergent-missions>Emergent Missions</h3><p>Adds dynamic escort, patrol, search and destroy, and some other mission types, all based on what actually is happening in your area. Patrol missions actually have a fleet commander that assigns targets for you, bounty kill missions are targetting ships that actually annoyed the faction that gives the quest. Reward is based on your performance instead of being static - kill more/do more damage, get higher payment. You can also assign your ships to do some of these for you - you simply have to pick up the reward once they&rsquo;re done.</p><p>My 7.0 playthrough is more mercenary-themed than pirate-themed, and these fit great - I assign a fleet to patrol missions while going to head hunt myself. You can customize how high the rewards are, and the required reputation to receive the mission offers.</p><p>Author: kuertee<br>Links: <a href=https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/780 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Nexus</a></p><h3 id=jobs-shuffle>Jobs Shuffle</h3><p>Allows AI with certain jobs to fly to sectors other than DLC they were added in.
