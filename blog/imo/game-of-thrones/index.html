I really disliked how hyped it is. For some reason I hated how everyone is talking about it.<br>However, this summer I decided to catch up. I was fed up with spoilers all over the place - it was really hard to avoid them. Honestly, spoiling shows and films should be against the law, but unfortunately it isn&rsquo;t, so it was about time to watch this thing.</p><p>Now, I&rsquo;m not good at reviews, so I might not talk about everything I should. Treat this post (and all other IMO posts) as just opinions and thoughts rather than a comprehensive review.</p><div class="details admonition warning open"><div class="details-summary admonition-title"><i class="icon fas fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw"></i>Potential Spoilers Warning<i class="details-icon fas fa-angle-right fa-fw"></i></div><div class=details-content><div class=admonition-content>I try to avoid direct spoilers, but I may talk about stuff that some people would consider a spoiler. If you haven&rsquo;t watched the show yet, you should do it before reading this post, or any other topic about GoT on the internet for that matter. You have been warned.</div></div></div><h2 id=the-pacing-is-strange>The pacing is&mldr; strange</h2><p>This show definitely does have a strange pacing. It general, it mostly takes the time to develop story, and then suddenly there&rsquo;s a twist and stuff happen fast. Such twists happen often, too, so it&rsquo;s a strange balance. But this is not a negative thing. I feel like this gives a good overall effect: gives time to accommodate with what&rsquo;s happening, and shocks when needed.</p><p>I found it surprising that plot twist and fast actions didn&rsquo;t usually happen at the season finale, like it usually happens with TV shows. In fact, season finales happened to be slower than one or two episodes before them. Yet again, I consider it to be a positive thing - surprises are good in TV. And things are more surprising when they happen when least expected.</p><h2 id=i-cant-decide-if-i-like-them>I can&rsquo;t decide if I like them!</h2><p>I like the characters, that&rsquo;s for sure. Even if I dislike them, I like them. The thing about characters - my opinion about them shifted over the course of the show.</p><p>Most notable example is Jaime. I think anyone who watched the show will agree that at the beginning it was one of the most hate-able characters in GoT. Then, he redeemed himself, just to go back to being an idiot. It happened multiple times. However because of this, by the later parts of the show I was neither hating him or loving him. He was there, an integral part of the story, and sometimes I could applaud his behaviour, while the other times I would just go &ldquo;this idiot should just die already&rdquo;.</p><p>Similar feelings I have about the Hound. However, with him it was way more straightforward, as he simply became better over the time.<br>Varys is an another example of a character I couldn&rsquo;t decide what I feel about. My opinion of him was changing from episode to episode.<br>The same can be said about many individuals in this story. Theon, his sister, or even Robb Stark (yes, I had mixed feelings about him, don&rsquo;t hate me for this).</p><p>Some characters were just hard to dislike, though. My favourite characters, Jon Snow and Tyrion, I always liked no matter what happened. I bet they&rsquo;re ones of favourite characters of everyone, and that&rsquo;s for a good reason. However, I can&rsquo;t tell what the reason is. They were just great characters, and Kit Harington and Peter Dinklage did a great job on the set. I must also say Jorah and Sam also were among my favourites - honestly, the cast did an incredible job!</p><p>Speaking of great cast, I can&rsquo;t not mention Lena Headey and Jack Gleeson. They had roles of probably the most hated characters in the series. The thing is, Cersei and Joffrey were **<em>meant</em> **to be hated. And I think everyone universally did hate them, which means the actors did it just right. Applause to them for that!</p><p>One more controversial opinion I have is about Deanerys. I disliked her at first, and I bet it was caused by all the hype around her - she was all around the place. Hell, even one of my exes was setting herself to be &ldquo;khaleesi&rdquo;. Because she got so much love, I felt I need to distance myself from her. But I gotta admit, she did grow on me over time. I can&rsquo;t say I ever loved her as much as most GoT fans, but I definitely went from slight disliking to just liking. That said, Emilia Clarke is definetely a good actress - she was able to convey Deanerys&rsquo; emotions more than all other cast with their characters.</p><p>What I didn&rsquo;t like though is that the show set a &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; sides and made it very visible. Of course, not all parts of the conflict in the Game of Thrones had that, but it clearly occurs that Starks side are the good ones and Lannisters side are the bad ones. Such approach does make sense, but I really wish there was more subtlety in that.</p><h2 id=the-wows>The &ldquo;wows&rdquo;</h2><p>There&rsquo;s definitely some amount of shock value in GoT. Nudity and gore were in almost every episode of the show. While I usually am just okay with these, I must admit, while I am pretty resistant to violence on the screen, there were a few moments that I had to look away from my monitor while watching. It didn&rsquo;t occur often, but I can barely think of any other show that caused me that, and GoT achieved that.</p><p>GoT has got plenty of &ldquo;wow&rdquo; moments. I&rsquo;ll try not to get into spoilers too much, but some moments, like the red wedding, left me with &ldquo;wow&rdquo; on my face. I didn&rsquo;t really like the characters involved as much (don&rsquo;t worry, I didn&rsquo;t hate them, they simply were just on my &ldquo;okay&rdquo; list), but I still felt shocked by the action twist. And since I didn&rsquo;t feel much connection with these characters, I believe it really shows the weight of plot twists in this show.</p><p>That said, not all moments were &ldquo;wow&rdquo; just because of something unexpected happening. Especially in the later seasons, I caught myself pressing &ldquo;go back 10 seconds&rdquo; button simply because something looked epic. And some of the less visually appealing ones were seriously empowered by the soundtrack (especially the scenes involving dragon queen or Melisandre). And speaking of soundtrack&mldr;</p><h2 id=the-intro>The intro</h2><p>&mldr; the intro is amazing. And I am not talking about the animation itself, even though it&rsquo;s great too. The soundtrack in the intro is a masterpiece. Seriously.</p><p>I believe the right intro plays a great role in how we perceive the show. If intros are great, then whenever the show starts, you know you did the right thing by pressing the &ldquo;play&rdquo; button. It just makes you want to watch the thing. And I must honestly say, GoT intro joins The 100 and The X Files on my list of the best TV intros.</p><p>I no longer wonder why it became iconic. And why Leo made a cover of it&mldr;</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6austQHyJQU style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=the-last-season>The last season</h2><p>Last thing I want to tackle is the controversy of the last season.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll see many people arguing that the last season completely ruined the show. People keep shouting &ldquo;bad writing&rdquo; and all that. Now, let me get it straight - I respect other people&rsquo;s opinions, but majority of the people crying didn&rsquo;t say anything constructive at all. Most couldn&rsquo;t back up their claim, and only stick to &ldquo;it&rsquo;s shit&rdquo; as an argument.</p><p>However I have to agree that the last season definitely feels rushed. It could be longer, and cover more lore etc etc. This one is true, and I can&rsquo;t disagree with it. The story should be expanded, more thought should be put into writing, and all that. The show deserved a more elaborate and thoughtful ending. And some of the evolving plots never came to conclusion.<br>The problem is, I believe most people shout that this season is bad because of the events that happened. Characters snapped, made stupid choices, died, and all that. But honestly, what did you expect from the end of a show? Not to mention that some of those &lsquo;plot twists&rsquo; were really to be expected.</p><p>I think the last season was okay. It as good compared to previous ones, but it was okay. Favourite characters dying or doing something stupid doesn&rsquo;t ruin the show - it&rsquo;s a part of the story, and after all the seasons, people should be used to such stuff happening. In fact, audience&rsquo;s favourite characters being immortal is among the lamest things story writers can do.</p><p>The second last episode left me in &ldquo;wow&rdquo; emotion (although I wasn&rsquo;t really surprised by what happened), and the last one was really slow paced, which IMO fit GoT story very well - soothing after a lot happening in the show. While many people hated it, I believe it was done right, even though not necessarily perfect.</p><div class=testimonial><div class=image-container><img src=https://cdn.tehgm.net/global/img/tehgm_avatar.png alt=Avatar></div><div class=content><h2>My opinion?</h2><p>GoT is a fine show. I liked it. I still think it was bit overhyped - it won&rsquo;t beat The Expanse, The 100 and The X Files for me, but I probably could place it 4th. I am not 100% sure about it, but over the time the show indeed did grow on me, and I must say it&rsquo;s actually good - just not as good as people hyped it to be, compared to my other favourites. But yes, this is a purely subjective verdict.</p><div class=stars><span class="fas fa-star"></span><span class="fas fa-star"></span><span class="fas fa-star"></span><span class="fas fa-star"></span><span class="far fa-star"></span></div></div></div></div><div class=post-footer id=post-footer><div class=post-info><div class=post-info-line><div class=post-info-mod><span>Updated on 22.09.2019</span></div><div class=post-info-license></div></div><div class=post-info-line><div class=post-info-md></div><div class=post-info-share><span><a href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on Twitter" data-sharer=twitter data-url=https://tehgm.net/blog/imo/game-of-thrones/ data-title="IMO: Game of Thrones" data-via=TehOriginalGM data-hashtags=entertainment,tv><i class="fab fa-twitter fa-fw"></i></a><a href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on Facebook" data-sharer=facebook data-url=https://tehgm.net/blog/imo/game-of-thrones/ data-hashtag=entertainment><i class="fab fa-facebook-square fa-fw"></i></a><a href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on WhatsApp" data-sharer=whatsapp data-url=https://tehgm.net/blog/imo/game-of-thrones/ data-title="IMO: Game of Thrones" data-web><i class="fab fa-whatsapp fa-fw"></i></a><a href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on Tumblr" data-sharer=tumblr data-url=https://tehgm.net/blog/imo/game-of-thrones/ data-title="IMO: Game of Thrones" data-caption="My opinion on Game of Thrones" data-tags=entertainment,tv><i class="fab fa-tumblr fa-fw"></i></a><a href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on Hacker News" data-sharer=hackernews data-url=https://tehgm.net/blog/imo/game-of-thrones/ data-title="IMO: Game of Thrones"><i class="fab fa-hacker-news fa-fw"></i></a><a href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on Reddit" data-sharer=reddit data-url=https://tehgm.net/blog/imo/game-of-thrones/><i class="fab fa-reddit fa-fw"></i></a><a href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on Myspace" data-sharer=myspace data-url=https://tehgm.net/blog/imo/game-of-thrones/ data-title="IMO: Game of Thrones" data-description="My opinion on Game of Thrones"><i data-svg-src=/lib/simple-icons/icons/myspace.min.svg></i></a></span></div></div></div><div class=post-info-more><section class=post-tags><i class="fas fa-tags fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;<a href=/blog/tags/entertainment/>entertainment</a>,&nbsp;<a href=/blog/tags/tv/>tv</a></section><section><span><a href=javascript:void(0); onclick=window.history.back();>Back</a></span>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<span><a href=/>Home</a></span></section></div><div class=post-nav><a href=/blog/imo/ultimate-chicken-horse/ class=next rel=next title="IMO: Ultimate Chicken Horse">IMO: Ultimate Chicken Horse<i class="fas fa-angle-right fa-fw"></i></a></div></div></article></div></main><footer class=footer><div class=footer-container><div class=footer-line><i class="far fa-copyright fa-fw"></i><span itemprop=copyrightYear>2020</span><span class=author itemprop=copyrightHolder>&nbsp;<a href=https://tehgm.net target=_blank>TehGM</a></span></div></div></footer></div><div id=fixed-buttons><a href=# id=back-to-top class=fixed-button title="Back to Top"><i class="fas fa-arrow-up fa-fw"></i></a><a href=# id=view-comments class=fixed-button title="View Comments"><i class="fas fa-comment fa-fw"></i></a></div><link rel=stylesheet href=/lib/lightgallery/lightgallery.min.css><script type=text/javascript src=/lib/smooth-scroll/smooth-scroll.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/lib/lazysizes/lazysizes.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/lib/lightgallery/lightgallery.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/lib/lightgallery/lg-thumbnail.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/lib/lightgallery/lg-zoom.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/lib/clipboard/clipboard.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/lib/sharer/sharer.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/lib/typeit/typeit.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript>window.config={"code":{"copyTitle":"Copy to clipboard","maxShownLines":10},"comment":{},"data":{"id-1":"TehGM","id-2":"TehGM"},"lightGallery":{"actualSize":false,"exThumbImage":"data-thumbnail","hideBarsDelay":2000,"selector":".lightgallery","speed":400,"thumbContHeight":80,"thumbWidth":80,"thumbnail":true},"typeit":{"cursorChar":null,"cursorSpeed":null,"data":{"id-1":["id-1"],"id-2":["id-2"]},"duration":null,"speed":null}};</script><script type=text/javascript src=/js/theme.min.js></script></body></html>
