But small amount of letters doesn&rsquo;t mean the post is not important - and this one is of <strong>HUGE</strong> importance.</p><h2 id=donate-to-charity-it-really-is-worth-it>Donate to charity, it really is worth it</h2><p>I was telling my friends and family for a long time that once I have a stable income, I&rsquo;ll be donating to charity. Today I officially started my monthly donations.</p><p>The main thing is: if you earn money and don&rsquo;t live 1st-to-1st, you most likely can afford to help others. You don&rsquo;t need to donate much. I always say &ldquo;skip one Starbucks a month&rdquo;. That means about 4-5 british pounds a month if you live in UK. Now think about it - is 5 pounds once a month really much to you? It may be, but if it is the case, you&rsquo;re either cheap or need help yourself. In the former case, shame on you. In the latter - please contact some charity, I believe you deserve better.</p><p>But again, the amount is not important. Donate as much or as little as you can - the point is, if you earn money, you _most likely _(with some very extreme exceptions) can afford to spare few coins per month to help others. To you it&rsquo;ll be almost nothing - to someone it can mean <strong>a lot</strong>.</p><h2 id=which-charity>Which charity?</h2><p>The answer to this question is simple - any charity that isn&rsquo;t an obvious scam. It doesn&rsquo;t matter who you help - there are many people (and not only people - think animals) that need help for various legit reasons.</p><p>I personally chose <a href=https://www.godsmack.com/scarsfoundation target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">The Scars Foundation</a>, a charity founded by my lifetime-favourite band Godsmack. They aim to help people with mental issues - such as depression. Almost everyone suffered from it at some point in their life, and many were lucky enough to recover on their own - but there are many people who do need help. Do you remember how you felt when you suffered from depression? I do. It&rsquo;s anything but nice. No one deserves to feel like that. Let&rsquo;s help others battle this problem!</p><p>But you can pick something completely different. I chose Godsmack&rsquo;s initiative because I&rsquo;ve been following the band for many years now. But it wasn&rsquo;t always my target - I actually decided I&rsquo;ll start donating even before Sully announced <a href=https://www.godsmack.com/scarsfoundation target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">The Scars Foundation</a> (which in fact happened to be on the concert I attended to with my brother - it was awesome, thank you Godsmack!). But I knew I want to help even before that - if not Godsmack, it would just be an another foundation.</p><h2 id=what-is-in-it-for-you>What is in it for you?</h2><p>First of all - if you really are asking that, you should question your moral values. Shame.</p><p>Secondly - helping others feels awesome. Seeing someone smile and realizing that you have had an impact on that is just heart-warming. If you ever helped someone, you probably know what I mean. If you didn&rsquo;t&mldr; well, it&rsquo;s time you get that feeling of being helpful, too.</p><p>Everyone wishes to be happy. Literally everyone wishes that. Humans and other species alike. You want to be happy - help others be happy as well.</p><h2 id=do-i-have-to-donate-cash>Do I have to donate cash?</h2><p>No. Money is just the simplest manner of helping, one that almost anyone can get involved in. But if you want to do something first-hand instead of just sending money, any legit foundation will happily take that. Even if they don&rsquo;t advertise that - message them. I&rsquo;ll be really surprised (and negatively shocked) if they turn down your help proposal (unless it&rsquo;s something stupid, but I assume that if you&rsquo;re reading this post, you won&rsquo;t try anything dumb).</p><h2 id=conclusions>Conclusions</h2><p>Just donate to a charity. No matter what form, if you have a stable income, you most likely not only can afford it, but also not even notice the slightly less amount of cash you have - and you may change someone&rsquo;s life for better. And if you can&rsquo;t donate, think of other ways you can help. There is always something you can do.</p><p>I added a link to <a href=https://www.godsmack.com/scarsfoundation target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">The Scars Foundation</a> on the side panel of this blog. You can join me in helping them, but feel free to choose other charity if you wish - no matter what you pick, there will be someone somewhere who will be really thankful to you.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-wSrljiomEw style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div></div><div class=post-footer id=post-footer><div class=post-info><div class=post-info-line><div class=post-info-mod><span>Updated on 05.10.2019</span></div><div class=post-info-license></div></div><div class=post-info-line><div class=post-info-md></div><div class=post-info-share><span></span></div></div></div><div class=post-info-more><section class=post-tags></section><section><span><a href=javascript:void(0); onclick=window.history.back();>Back</a></span>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<span><a href=/>Home</a></span></section></div><div class=post-nav><a href=/blog/unspoken-benefit-owning-domain/ class=prev rel=prev title="Unspoken benefit of owning a domain"><i class="fas fa-angle-left fa-fw"></i>Unspoken benefit of owning a domain</a>
