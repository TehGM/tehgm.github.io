However, for many use cases, REST WebAPI is also desirable.

It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a hard task, nor it was a very long one - but still I encountered some challenges, so I decided to document that. Plus when a change like this happens, some explanation is needed anyway.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dangers of Sequential IDs</title><link>https://tehgm.net/blog/dangers-of-sequential-ids/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 16:15:21 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://tehgm.net/blog/dangers-of-sequential-ids/</guid><description>&lt;p>IDs sometimes need to be made public - be it for use in links, WebAPI requests, or in-app referencing.
