Recently I started playing Stalker Anomaly. I got that itch for Escape from Tarkov - but that game is difficult, scares me when I play alone, and neither [my brother](https://bloodxtract.com/members/BornToLose) nor [best friend](https://kalik.dev) want to buy it. Stubborn!  
But meanwhile, I found out about mod for Stalker Call of Pripyat called **[Anomaly](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly)**. And it seems to scratch at least some of that itch.

And this mod is standalone (and free, but that's a minor - I already have all 3 Stalker games), and... it allows installing its own mods (well, called "addons" technically)! And a few people expressed interest in it when I started talking about it, so I figured I build up a modpack with the mods I use... so here it comes!

## Stalker Anomaly
The modpack of course requires Stalker Anomaly itself. This is obvious, yes - this section is just to provide easy download link!  
Stalker Anomaly can be downloaded from its [ModDB page](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly) - just scroll the description to "Download and Installation" section.

Download size: *~8.75GB*

## The Modpack
The modpack is just a collection of the mods I use - and I use them, so I know they work. But besides that, there's nothing special about it - it's not exhaustive by any means and all that.  
The mods in this pack are all compatible with **Stalker Anomaly 1.5.1**.

The modpack comes in two flavours - the main modpack contains sound and texture mods, so it's quite big. For that reason, I also built a *Lite* version of the modpack that simply doesn't include the graphics and sound mods.  
Both packs are WinRar archives with maximum compression possible.

### Main Pack
The default version of the pack - includes all mods I use.

## Installation
These installation steps are for installing the mods with Mod Manager. It is possible to install them without one, but I'll not cover that here - mod manager just makes it better.
1. Download JSGME mod manager from [ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-chernobyl/downloads/jsgme).
2. Install JSGME by extracting directly into your Stalker Anomaly directory.
3. Extract "MODS" folder into your Stalker Anomaly directory.
4. Run JSGME.exe.
5. Enable each mod. Confirm when it prompts about overwriting. Note: order matters for some mods, see [below](#recommended-mod-order) for my mod order.
6. Start a new game.

### Recommended Mod Order
For some mods in the pack, the installation order matters - some depend on eachother etc. You are welcome to tweak it, but this is the order I recommend, as it works for me.

1. `JSRS P.1 - Main Addon`
2. `EfTfootstep1.1`
3. `HD_Models`
4. `Anomaly Magazines 0.4.0.4`
5. `Anomaly Scopes`
6. `Arszi's Mutant Bleeding`
7. `Warfare Alife Overhaul - Main`
8. `Scope_Fix_For_Few_Weapons_v0.02c`
9. `Trader Overhaul`
10. `Better Weapon & Outfit Condition On Drop - Version 6 (Hardcore)`
11. `High Res PDA Maps`
12. `SCO3 P.1 Real Mutant Sounds`
13. `SCO3 P.2 New Outdoor Sounds`
14. `SCO3 P.3 New Underground Sounds`
15. `SCO3 P.4 Dead Zone (No Animal Sounds)`
16. `SCO3 Addon - Anomaly Sounds`

{{<admonition type=note >}}
Note: if you downloaded [Lite version](#lite-pack) of the pack, some of these mods will not be there - just ignore them.

## Disclaimers
First and foremost, I am not the author of any of these mods, and I do not take credit for them. I also take no responsibility if the mod caused any damage to your game or computer - I am using these mods as well, so we're both in it.

All mods were downloaded from [ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons).

Lastly, this mod list is not exhaustive by any means - feel free to remove ones you dislike and add new ones. However I cannot guarantee that the game won't crash if you do that.
