    <h3>Some of my blog posts are review-ish in nature - this is what I call "IMO" posts!</h3>
    <p>They're not called reviews because they're fully subjective, but otherwise, they function just as that.<br/>Find out what I think about various TV shows, games, etc!</p>

            <p>These posts might contain minor spoilers. I do my best to not avoid any significant spoilers, but it's not always possible to 'review' something without at least tiny ones.</p>
            <p>But do not worry! I added support for special spoiler boxes which will be closed by default. Also, I implemented Discord-style spoiler mask - it'll hide spoiler text if you click on it -> ||Spoiler Example||!</p>
