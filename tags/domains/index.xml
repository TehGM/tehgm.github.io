<p>Recently I bought a domain (<a href="http://tehgm.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">tehgm.net</a>). Since then, I was browsing internet for ideas what to do with it. Many people posted about perks of owning a domain - claiming your online presence, hosting a blog or URL shortener, to name a few. But I haven&rsquo;t seem many unique ideas.</p>
